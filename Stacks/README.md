## Stack
## Quick notes

 A stack is a linear data structure in computer science that follows a particular order of operations called Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). It is named "stack" because it resembles a stack of objects where the last item placed on top is the first one to be removed.

The stack operates with two primary operations:

1. Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack. The newly added element becomes the top of the stack, and the size of the stack increases.

2. Pop: This operation removes the topmost element from the stack. The element that was added last is the first one to be removed, and the size of the stack decreases.

In addition to these basic operations, there are a few other common operations associated with stacks:

3. Peek or Top: This operation retrieves the topmost element from the stack without removing it.

4. IsEmpty: This operation checks if the stack is empty and returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack contains any elements or not.

Stacks are commonly implemented using arrays or linked lists. When using an array, a fixed-size array can be used, or a dynamic array implementation can allow for the stack to grow or shrink as needed. In the case of linked list implementation, each node in the linked list represents an element in the stack, and the top of the stack is represented by the head of the list.

Stacks are used in various applications, including function call stack management in programming languages, expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and undo/redo functionality in text editors, among others.
