# Sorts
## Quick notes

Sorting is a  fundamental concept in computer science that deal with organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Here's a brief description of several basic sorting algorithms.

1. Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted. The largest or smallest elements "bubble" to the top or bottom of the list in each iteration.

2. Quick Sort: Quick Sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, one with elements smaller than the pivot and another with elements larger than the pivot. This process is recursively applied to the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

3. Merge Sort: Merge Sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a sorted array. It uses a temporary array to store intermediate results during the merging process.

4. Insertion Sort: Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It starts with the second element and inserts it into its correct position among the previously sorted elements. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

5. Selection Sort: Selection Sort is another simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the array into two portions: the sorted portion at the beginning and the unsorted portion at the end. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion.

6. Heap Sort: Heap Sort is based on the concept of a binary heap, a complete binary tree where every parent node is greater (or smaller) than its children. It involves building a max-heap (for ascending order) or min-heap (for descending order) from the input array, extracting the root element (largest or smallest), and repeatedly re-heapifying the remaining elements until the array is sorted.

These are just a few examples of basic sorting algorithms commonly taught in data structures courses. There are many other sorting algorithms with different characteristics and complexities that are used in various scenarios based on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
