# Trees
## Quick Notes

A tree is a widely used data structure in computer science that represents a hierarchical structure. It consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node can have zero or more child nodes.

In a tree, there is a special node called the root, which is the topmost node and serves as the starting point for traversing the tree. The root has no parent nodes but can have child nodes. The child nodes are connected to their parent node by edges.

Each node in a tree can have any number of child nodes, but each child node has only one parent. Nodes that have no child nodes are called leaf nodes. The path from the root to any leaf node is called a branch.

Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the organization of files and directories in a file system, the structure of a webpage, or the organization of data in a database. They provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Some common terminologies associated with trees include:

Parent: The node that has child nodes.
Child: The nodes that are connected to a parent node.
Siblings: Nodes that share the same parent.
Ancestor: A node's parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on.
Descendant: A node's child, grandchild, great-grandchild, and so on.
Depth: The number of edges from the root to a node.
Height: The number of edges on the longest path from a node to a leaf.
Trees can have different variations depending on their characteristics and specific purposes, such as binary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, B-trees, and many others. Each variation has its own rules and properties, making it suitable for various applications and optimizing specific operations.

Overall, trees provide an efficient and organized way to store and manipulate hierarchical data structures, making them a fundamental tool in computer science and programming.
